# Instructor Guide - Introduction

Welcome to the instructor guide for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This guide provides comprehensive resources to help you effectively teach the course, including weekly lesson plans, assessment rubrics, pedagogical notes, and troubleshooting guides.

## Course Overview

This 13-week course introduces students to the integration of artificial intelligence with robotics, specifically focusing on embodied intelligence. The course is structured around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2 (Weeks 1-3)**: Robot Operating System as the nervous system of robotics
2. **Gazebo/Unity (Weeks 4-6)**: Simulation environments as digital twins
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 7-9)**: AI-robot brains with perception and VSLAM
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) (Weeks 10-13)**: Integrating vision, language, and action planning

## Learning Objectives Alignment

Each module and week has specific learning objectives aligned with the overall course goals:

- Students will understand the architecture and implementation of modern robotic systems
- Students will connect AI models to physical robotic platforms
- Students will develop embodied AI systems that can interpret natural language commands
- Students will evaluate and validate robotic system performance

## Required Resources

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA RTX workstation with GPU for AI model training and inference
- Intel RealSense cameras for perception
- NVIDIA Jetson platforms for robot deployment
- Robot platforms with 6+ DOF manipulators (UR3, Panda, or equivalent)
- Additional sensors (LiDAR, force/torque sensors)

### Software Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- NVIDIA Isaac ROS packages
- Gazebo Harmonic or Unity Robotics
- Python 3.10+ with relevant AI libraries
- Docker for containerized deployment

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment
- Weekly lab exercises with peer review
- In-class coding challenges
- Concept checks during lectures
- Discussion forums for troubleshooting

### Summative Assessment
- Weekly quizzes (multiple choice and short answer)
- Programming assignments with rubric-based grading
- Lab reports with technical analysis
- Final capstone project with presentation

## Pedagogical Approach

The course employs a hands-on, project-based learning approach that emphasizes:

1. **Embodied Cognition**: Learning through doing, with physical or simulated robots
2. **Spiral Curriculum**: Revisiting concepts with increasing complexity
3. **Collaborative Learning**: Group projects and peer programming
4. **Real-World Application**: Connecting theoretical concepts to practical implementations

## Accessibility Considerations

### For Students with Disabilities
- Provide alternative text for all images and diagrams
- Offer multiple modalities for content consumption (text, video, interactive)
- Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies
- Provide extended time for practical assessments

### For Students with Different Technical Backgrounds
- Offer pre-course preparation materials for students with limited programming experience
- Provide additional resources for students with stronger backgrounds to explore advanced topics
- Create peer-mentoring opportunities to support collaborative learning

## Course Schedule Recommendations

The course can be taught in various formats:

### 13-Week Semester Format
- 2-3 hours of lectures per week
- 3-4 hours of lab time per week
- Weekly assignments due before the next week's lab
- Midterm and final projects

### Intensive Workshop Format
- 6-8 hours per day for 13 days
- Alternating lecture and hands-on sessions
- Daily assignments and checkpoints
- Final project due at the end of the workshop

## Getting Started

This instructor guide contains detailed information for each week, including:

- **Learning Objectives**: What students should know and be able to do
- **Lesson Plans**: Detailed daily schedules with activities
- **Assessment Rubrics**: Grading criteria for assignments and projects
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Extension Activities**: For students needing additional challenges
- **Resource Lists**: Additional materials for deeper exploration

Use this guide in conjunction with the student-facing materials to ensure alignment between instruction and student expectations. Each week builds upon the previous, so maintaining the sequence is important for student success.

## Technical Preparation

Before beginning the course, ensure that all technical infrastructure is in place:

1. **Robot Platforms**: Test all robot platforms with required software packages
2. **Simulation Environment**: Verify that all students can access and run simulations
3. **Software Installation**: Prepare installation scripts and images to streamline setup
4. **Network Configuration**: Ensure stable network connections for collaborative tools and software repositories
5. **Safety Protocols**: Review and implement all safety measures for robot operation
