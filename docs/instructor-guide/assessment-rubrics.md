# Instructor Guide - Assessment Rubrics

This section provides detailed rubrics for evaluating student work throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Each rubric is aligned with learning objectives and provides clear criteria for assessment.

## General Grading Philosophy

The course uses competency-based assessment with an emphasis on practical implementation and problem-solving skills. Students are evaluated on both technical competency and their ability to apply concepts to real-world robotic problems.

### Grade Scale
- **A (90-100%)**: Demonstrates mastery of concepts with sophisticated implementations
- **B (80-89%)**: Shows solid understanding with effective implementations
- **C (70-79%)**: Meets basic requirements with adequate implementations
- **D (60-69%)**: Partial completion with significant issues
- **F (Below 60%)**: Inadequate completion or fundamental misunderstandings
