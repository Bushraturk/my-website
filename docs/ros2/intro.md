# Introduction to ROS 2

<ROS2Personalization />

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! In this module, you'll learn about the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system of modern robotics.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and environments.

Unlike traditional operating systems, ROS 2 is not an actual OS but rather a middleware that provides services designed specifically for robotics applications, including hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, and package management.

## Key Concepts

In this module, we'll cover:

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Streams of messages passed between nodes
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that nodes can share
- **Launch files**: Mechanisms to start multiple nodes at once

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module (Weeks 1-3), you will be able to:

- Set up and configure a ROS 2 development environment
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Design message passing between nodes using topics and services
- Understand the ROS 2 ecosystem and its packages
- Debug and visualize ROS 2 applications

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Module Structure

- **Week 1-2**: ROS 2 Architecture and Fundamentals
- **Week 3**: Advanced ROS 2 Concepts and Integration

Let's begin with [Week 1-2: ROS 2 Architecture and Fundamentals](./week1-2.md).
