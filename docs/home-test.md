# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics!

This textbook is designed to take you through the journey of understanding how artificial intelligence meets the physical world through robotics.

## About This Course

This comprehensive 13-week textbook covers the cutting-edge intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. You'll learn to build embodied AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world using state-of-the-art technologies including ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo/Unity simulation, and Vision-Language-Action models.

## Course Overview

This 13-week course is structured around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2 (Weeks 1-3)**: Learn about the Robot Operating System, the nervous system of robotics
2. **Gazebo/Unity (Weeks 4-6)**: Explore simulation environments that act as digital twins
3. **NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 7-9)**: Understand AI-robot brains, perception, and VSLAM
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) (Weeks 10-13)**: Integrate vision, language, and action planning
