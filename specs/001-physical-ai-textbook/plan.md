# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [link](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive AI-native textbook for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The textbook will be built using Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages, covering 4 core modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) with structured content for a 13-week course. The solution includes content organization by weeks, lab exercises, assessments, hardware setup guides, and AI-driven content generation capabilities.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (for Docusaurus), Python (for content generation scripts)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.x, React 18.x, Node.js 18+, GitHub Pages, Claude Code API
**Storage**: Git repository hosting content, GitHub Pages for deployment
**Testing**: Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript unit tests, Playwright for end-to-end tests
**Target Platform**: Web-based (accessible via browsers), with downloadable content for offline use
**Project Type**: Web application (static site generated by Docusaurus)
**Performance Goals**: <3 seconds page load time, 99.5% uptime, support 1000+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: High-performance machines needed for ROS 2 and simulation components; compatibility with robotics tools (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA)
**Scale/Scope**: 13-week course textbook with 4 core modules, weekly content breakdown, lab exercises, and assessments

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the project constitution and requirements:

### Gate 1: Library-First Approach
- ✅ **PASS**: The Docusaurus-based textbook can be structured as a modular library of content components
- The textbook content (modules, labs, assessments) can be organized as reusable components

### Gate 2: CLI Interface
- ✅ **PASS**: Docusaurus provides CLI tools for content management, build, and deployment
- Additional content generation scripts can expose CLI interfaces for AI-assisted content creation

### Gate 3: Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ✅ **PASS**: Testing strategy includes:
  - Content validation tests to ensure all links and references work
  - Accessibility tests to ensure content is usable by all students
  - Performance tests to verify page load times meet requirements

### Gate 4: Integration Testing
- ✅ **PASS**: Integration points that need testing:
  - AI content generation pipeline integration
  - Search functionality across all content
  - Downloadable content generation for offline use

### Gate 5: Observability and Versioning
- ✅ **PASS**: Built-in Docusaurus analytics for content usage
- Git-based versioning for content changes and updates
- Structured logging of content access patterns for optimization

### Gate 6: Simplicity
- ✅ **PASS**: Solution uses established Docusaurus framework rather than custom CMS
- Maintains simplicity while meeting the complex needs of a robotics textbook

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application structure using Docusaurus as the static site generator. This approach allows for modular content organization by modules and weeks as specified in the feature requirements, with reusable components for different content types (modules, labs, assessments). The structure follows Docusaurus conventions while supporting the 13-week course organization and multiple module types required.
